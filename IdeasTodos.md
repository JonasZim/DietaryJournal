A Tool to Track what you eat. Maybe not so much in a sense of quantity but quality. I.e. it counts what you have eaten throughout the week, what friuts and vegetables but doesnt really care how much youve eaten.

Maybe you can track how often you poop or bloatings. etc

Maybe some more healthy stuff tracking like sports, meditation etc

A todo plan where you can record medication etc.

A recommondation section of stuff to eat or some physical activity.

In general stuff that helps me show stuff in data for tracking to help me examine my Crohn's disease.
